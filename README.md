I'm a PhD candidate in Cognitive Science with 10+ years of experience working with multidisciplinary research. Throughout my career, I have gained experience in data collection, analysis and visualisation. 

My experiences have given me a well-rounded understanding of the data analysis lifecycle. Throughout my career I always found myself excited about analysing data - I find it incredibly rewarding to take raw data and turn it into something meaningful. I love the entire data analysis process, from gathering and cleaning the data to visualizing it in order to draw useful insights!

My passion for programming and analysing data started with R. During my PhD I worked with R and RStudio to clean, analyse and visualise my data. I also used NVivo to perform qualitative analysis on survey data, and I subsequently honed these skills in two different projects as a research assistant.
In the past year, I've added SQL, Python and Tableau to my data toolkit.

I love all aspects of working with data:

Data Architecture & Collection - Designing a database before data collection that will facilitate data analysis is the dream, and I have done that in a few of the projects I've worked on.

Data Wrangling - When analysing data, I believe understanding the data at hand and looking at it thoroughly is important to ensure the reliability of the results from any analysis performed. One of the things I love the most is getting the data ready for analysis and R and Python are the main tools I use for that. 

Data Analysis & Visualisation - I use R, Python and Tableau to build visualisations that convey useful information to draw the best insights from the data. I use statistical packages in R and Python to run descriptive and inferential statistical analyses with the data and provide reliable and informative insights.

**Ps.: I believe data analsysis never stops and a dataset can always be analysed from a different perspective, generating new insights. Therefore, I am constantly updating my scripts and adding new bits to my analyses - so be sure to come back to check for updates!**
